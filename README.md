# basic_tkinter_programs
All about basic Tkinter programs that I made

at fist:
   You needs to import tkinter , of course cus this is tkinter program :) 
   and you needs to import tkinter.messagebox which directly come form tkinter ( * ) mean from messagebox    import all 

start definding objects 
def 1 * print_text : this is a basic program so I'dn't wunna take it serious if you copy this code to your editor this will show some fancy text ( " I bet you try it :3 ")

def 2 * clicktoexit : actiually it's " click to exit " :
                    by just wrting exit() or destory() you can end all the window in time ;o
     
def 3 * messagebox : it's know as showinfo :
                   : it can use as to warn user , info , user info input... like that this.
                   
yup these are the main part of the program , have fun and stay alive.
